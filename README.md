# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. 

- Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- Deliverable 2: The Empmloyees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
- Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)

## Resources:
- Data Tools: SQL, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, QuickDBD
- Original Datasets: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv

## Results
Quick DBD was used to map out the connections between the 6 tables provided
